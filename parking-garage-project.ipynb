    "# Parking Garage Project\n",
    "# Your assignment for today is to create a parking garage class to get more familiar with Object Oriented Programming(OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your parking gargage class should have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "# takeTicket\n",
    "# This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",
    "# This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
    "# payForParking\n",
    "# Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
    "# If the payment variable is not empty then -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
    "# This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
    "# leaveGarage\n",
    "# If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
    "# If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment\n",
